# Logrotate

Simple docker container that does logrotate. Designed as sidecar container for Kubernetes pods that
write logfiles but don't do rotation themselves.

## Considerations

- You most likely don't want to keep a ton of old log files in a running pod
- The purpose of this is solely to ensure logs don't fill up the disk - not long-term archival
- Instead, use a sidecar to `tail` the active log and let the K8S log collector handle the rest

## Usage

- Use shared volumes to share log files with a container that produces logfiles
- Set `LOGROTATE_PATTERN` etc. to configure what logrotate watches, log file size, etc.
- See [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) for a sample app

### Standalone

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
  --env CRON_SCHEDULE='' \
  --env LOGROTATE_SIZE=1M \
  --env LOGROTATE_PATTERN=/myapp/logs/*.log \
  -v logs:/myapp/logs
  quay.io/honestbee/logrotate
```

### Docker Compose

- Starts a small sample app that writes a logfile and rotates it:

  ```sh
  docker-compose up
  ```

## Customization

Most options below are substituted into the config file for logrotate, so please refer to the
[Manpage for logrotate](https://linux.die.net/man/8/logrotate) for detailled documentation.

|Option|Default|Description|
|------|-------|-----------|
|`CRON_SCHEDULE`|`0 * * * *`|Cron schedule for logrotate command|
|`LOGROTATE_SIZE`|`100M`|Maximum size of log files|
|`LOGROTATE_MODE`|`copytruncate`|Mode of log rotation|
|`LOGROTATE_PATTERN`|`/logs/*.log`|Path pattern of log files to manage|
|`LOGROTATE_ROTATE`|`0`|Number of old log files to keep|

## Alternatives

[blacklabelops/logrotate](https://github.com/blacklabelops/logrotate) allows more configuration
options but was not chosen on grounds of the images not being controlled by us and the sensitive
nature of logs.
